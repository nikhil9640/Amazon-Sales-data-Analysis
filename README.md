## Units Sold: 
Analysis of the number of units sold, providing insights into product popularity and inventory turnover.

## Key Metrics: 
Evaluation of critical metrics such as average order value, conversion rates, and customer acquisition costs to measure performance and optimize strategies.

# Problem Statement 
Sales management has gained importance due to increasing competition and the need for improved distribution methods to reduce costs and increase profits. Sales management today is the most important function in a commercial and business enterprise. Do ETL: Extract-Transform-Load the Amazon dataset and find the Sales-trend-> month-wise, year-wise, yearly_month wise

# Objectives of the Project 
## Identify Sales Trends: 
Analyze monthly and yearly revenue to uncover seasonal patterns and growth trajectories.

## Revenue Calculation: 
Determine total revenue generated to assess overall financial performance.

## Evaluate Sales Volume: 
Measure total sales to understand market demand and performance efficiency.

## Units Sold Analysis: 
Assess the quantity of units sold to gauge product popularity and inventory turnover rates.

## Key Metrics Evaluation: 
Analyze critical metrics such as average order value, conversion rates, and customer acquisition costs to optimize sales strategies.

## Data-Driven Decision Making: 
Provide actionable insights to inform strategic business decisions and improve sales outcomes.

# How to use this repository 
Excel files - Excel files are the source data for the project.
Pbix file - It is the PowerBI file in which the interactive dashboard is there so that any user can use it accordingly.
Presentation file - This is the file that contains all the relevant insights about the project.
Readme file - It gives the overview of the project.
High Level Design file - High-Level Design is a initial step in development of applications where overall structure of a system is planned. High-Level design focuses mainly on how different components of the system work together without getting to know about internal coding and implementation. This helps everyone involving in the project to understand the goals and ensures good communication during development.
Low Level Design file - Low-Level Design, is a phase in the software development process where detailed system components and their interactions are specified, along with their implementation. It involves converting the high-level design into a more detailed blueprint, addressing specific algorithms, data structures, and interfaces. LLD serves as a guide for developers during coding, which ensures the accurate and efficient implementation of the systemâ€™s functionality.
